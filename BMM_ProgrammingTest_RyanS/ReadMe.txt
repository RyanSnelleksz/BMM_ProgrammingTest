This is my code for the BMM Programming Test.

In order to run this code, double click the .sln file and click the green right facing triangle at the top (if you're using visual studio).

In the main file(BMM_ProgrammingTest_RyanS.cpp), you can change how many simulations it will run, currently set to 100,000, and whther it will play or itself or
give you prompts to you can play.

If you want to play it, change simulationCount to 1 and change Update(True) to Update(False);
