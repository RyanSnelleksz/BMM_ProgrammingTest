This is my code for the BMM Programming Test.

If you want to just play the game, open the build folder and double click the .exe file, it will prompt you to pick numbers to play.

In order to run this code, double click the .sln file and click the green right facing triangle at the top (if you're using visual studio).

In the main file(BMM_ProgrammingTest_RyanS.cpp), you can change how many simulations it will run, currently set to 100,000, and whether it will play or itself or
give you prompts so you can play.
